# Introduction
There are a number of language families in the world, and they cover all the languages spoken by humans among them. Some languages, however, are *isolates* – not classified in any family.  

Many languages die because people stop speaking them. Speakers of many languages do not teach their children, in favour of more widely spoken languages, and lesser spoken languages thus go extinct.  
Examples of this include Badeshi, spoken in a remote village in Pakistan, and some of the languages of the Andaman Islands (Great Andamanese, Sentinelese, Jarawa and Onge).  

Efforts are being taken to save many of these languages.  

Many pidgins and creoles also fall under the endangered category.
