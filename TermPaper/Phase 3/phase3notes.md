## 3 Verb Morphology
### 3.1 General Principles
- principle same as other Semitic (99)
    - root and pattern
- root = three consonants (semantic abstraction)
    - e.g. KTB = write
        - maktab (desk)
        - maktaba (library)
        - muka:taba (correspondence)
        - ?iktita:b (subscription)
- constraints on consonants:
    - sonorants anywhere
    - C1, C2 not homorganic
    - C2, C3 either id or non-homorganic
    - C1, C3 usually not id or homorganic

- two types of patterns: morphosemantic, morphosyntactic (100)
- morphosemantic -> mainly three processes:
    - lengthening middle radical
    - long vowel betn radicals
    - consonantal affixes
- augmented roots are also abstractions
- morphosyntactic -> finite verb for aspect, voice
    - -> noun for agent, patient, instrument, etc
    - other syntactic categs by affixation

### 3.2 Root and Morphosemantic Patterns: MSA
- nine patterns can apply to any root
    - actually usually only 7 or 8 at most

- PI: the root pattern c1c2c3
    - basis of derivational morphology
    - most common
    - root -> PI verb by inserting short vowels (one pattern) (101)
    - a-a = action performed by agent
    - a-i = agent moyen
    - a-u = intransitive, acquisition of permanent qual.
- PII: lengthen middle radical c1c2c2c3
    - either make more intensive/extensive
    - or another agent
    - estimative/ascriptive
    - used for scientific vocab
    - sometimes int/ext in CLA -> causative in MSA (102)
- PIII: c1v:c2c3
    - conative: effort to achieve PI
- PIV: ?c1c2c3
    - causative/factitive
    - sometimes overlap with PIII
    - subset of inchoatives
- PV: tc1c2c3
    - effect of an action or reflexive
    - many verbs show stative I -> causative II -> effective/reflexive V
- PVI: t-PIII tc1v:c2c3 (103)
    - PVI : PVIII :: PV : PII
    - reciprocal action
    - stative relns among components, reciprocal actions
- PVII: n-PI nc1c2c3 (104)
    - passive of PI
    - similar to PV
- PVIII: c1tc2c3
    - reflexive sense, sometimes synonymous w PV
- PIX: c1c2c3c3
    - closed class of inchoative verbs
    - only colours and physical defects
- PX: st-PI stc1c2c3
    - reflexive or r-benefactive of PIV
    - also estimative/eductive
- other patterns (11-15) (105)
    - usually intensive
    - rare
- quadriliteral roots
    - usually c1c2c3c4, c1c2c1c2, c1c2c1c3, c1c2c3c3
    - derived from foreign borrowings too

### 3.3 Morphosyntactic Patterns of the Finite Verb: MSA
- distinction: patterns generating verbs vs. nouns (106)
    - misleading terms
- two finite verb stems
    - p-stem: PNG with affixes, marked for mood, "imperfect" kinda
    - s-stem: "perfect" kinda
- each has two sets of internal patterns for active, passive

- Pattern I
    - (107)
- augmented patterns
    - four patterns (108)

### 3.4 Verbal Affixes
- person, gender, number (109)
- two sets of affixes

- for p-stem (110)
    - base set: preformative
        - commonly used after lam/la: (commands)
    - u-set: -na/-ni to long v. sfx, -u to sfx-less
        - main verb, declarative
        - habitual
        - sa- for future
    - a-set: -a to all sfx-less
        - possible/intended/wanted
        - kinda subjunctive
        - lan- for neg. fut.

- s-stem direct

### 3.5 Morphophonological Adjustments
- sometimes above -> phonotactic violations
- two types: c_i = w/y or c2=c3 (111)

- Semivowels
    - c1 = semiv.
        - normal strong verbs
        - sometimes dropped in p-stem
        - action verbs, because of imperative? (112)
        - assimilated to t- in PVIII
    - c2 or c3 = semiv.
        - adjustments
        - some rules (113)
        - strength: a > i > u
        - but not where distinction is important
- C2 = C3 (116)
    - c2vc3 is stable if closed syllable
    - otherwise delete v
    - again, morphologically sensitive
    - c1_c2 epenthesis also may be needed

### 3.6 Dialectal Verb Morphology
- Introduction (117)
    - as a whole simpler (fewer categories)
        - some morphosemantic patterns lost (118)
        - reduction of semiv. irregularities
        - mood, voice in stem not affixes
- partly morphological redund
- partly synth -> analyt because of L2
- can't say CLA -> dialectal features

- Losses and Gains (119)
    - Urban Dialects (impt.)
        - number & gender
            - 2pl, 3pl gender gone

        - u/i in free var in stems (127)
        - v2 in CvCvCv deleted if high (s-stem) (128)
        - Arabia (129)
    - reduction in PI stem types (132)
        - four s-stem types
        - c3 = /?/
        - c1 = /?/
    - loss, extension of augmented patterns (135)
        - passives, mediopassives, reflexives

- active & passive (149)
- active = state in which subject is, after action/event

- passive participle as substantive = result (150)

- PI: p/a distinction in dialects (152)
    - idek

- sep. category of collective nouns

- pluralisation by suffixation (163)
    - MSA: u:na, i:na, a:tun, a:tin, a:ni, ayni
    - masc suffixes

## 3 Verb Morphology
### 3.1 General Principles
- general principle: root and pattern (99)
- root = semantic abstraction
- constraints (c1-c2 not homo, c2-c3 either id or non-homo)
- patterns of two types: morphosem & morphosyn (100)
    - morphosem: templates
        - modify root meaning
        - lengthen c2, insert long vowel, consonantal afx
    - morphosyn
        - for verbs: asp, voice
        - noun: agent, patient, instr, pl.
- then afx
    - verb: person, number, gender
    - noun: case, number

### 3.2 Root and Morphosemantic Patterns: MSA
- Pattern I (XYZ)
    - basis (abstract and concrete)
    - becomes verb XvYvZ (101)
    - sfx stem: a-a, a-i, a-u
        - a-a: action perf by agent
