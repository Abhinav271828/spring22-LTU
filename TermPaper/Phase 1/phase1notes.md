## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 The Early History of Arabic
- legend: Revelation by Gabriel to Muhammad p.23
- pre-Islamic 'time of ignorance'
- very unclear what 'arab' meant at the time
- second major event: conquests from 632 to 715
    - spain to central asia
    - popular belief: dialects came from corruption of CLA by subjects of Islamic empire
    - reality?
        - greek/coptic/persian retained as admin langs for byz, sasanian emps
        - phased out around 700, arabic imposed
        - widespread bilingualism in spoken form
        - some places still continues
        - indig langs re emerged some places later
        - codifying began in S. Iraq from mid700s, to specify the "best" arabic
        - so dialectal variation must have existed from Quranic times; sometimes even Quran is diff
        - Ferg argues that dialects have common features not in CLA, so origin is military koine; Cohen says no p.29
        - untenable

### 1.2 Early Written Evidence
- lot of texts from up to 912 p.31
- some bilingual
- Middle Arabic is a vague term, encompassing this and a later stage of the language
- regional particularities of Levant
    - loss of interdentals
    - tanween as emphasis on indef adj, nouns
    - demonstratives gender loss
    - lam used with incorrect vb form
    - laysa used as invariable neg particle

### 1.3 Early Dialectal Arabic
- early, medieval arab grammarians give useless info
- but there are dialects which were cut off from arab influence

#### 1.3.1 OA
#### 1.3.2 Sprachinseln
- malta
- cyprus

### 1.4 Substrates and Borrowing
- aramaic had influence on levantine dialects

### 1.5 Dialect Geography and Typology
- Maghrebi/Mashreqi dialects p. 41
- dialects are still very fuzzy
- one more dimension: bedouin/sedentary dialects
    - "bedouin are more conservative" but no
    - region is also a factor

### 1.6 Dialect Change, Large-scale, Small-scale
- 13cents of evolution
- many reasons for change: expulsion of tribes, invasion of Mongols p.43
- urbanisation etc also have changed

### 1.7 Types of Internal Linguistic Change
### 1.8 Indexicalisation
- new dimension of communal marking on dialectal forms

### 1.9 Pidginisation and Creolisation
### 1.10 Concluding Remarks

## 7 The Levant
### 7.1 The Geographical Area Covered
- "The Near East"; Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Turkey, Cyprus
- Syro-Lebanese group of dialects, but also Shawi, Mesopotamian and Anatolian

### 7.2 On the Eve of Arabicisation
- arabs and arabic been in Levant before conquests p.191
- these dialects not to be confused with dialects of peninsula which came later

### 7.3 The Sources and Their Interpretation
### 7.4 Levantine and Egyptian Dialects
- numerous similarities between levantine and egyptian dialects
- continuous contacts and relations over centuries

### 7.5 Phonetics and Phonology

# MA â€“ SFV
## 0
- diglossia of fusha and ammiyyah
### 0.1 Where Is Arabic Spoken?
- sole/joint OL in 20 indept states
- native language of Isr, Palestinians
- Quran
- UN
- many co-languages
### 0.2 Varieties of Arabic
- spoken arabic dialects are mother tongues before formal education
- continua
- may be mutually unintelligible but many factors work to reduce
- interdialectal contact
- CLA is an immutable linguistic phenomenon
    - part of the reason for "same language"
- MSA is modern desc. of CLA (same syntax)
    - all writing, speaking TV
    - formal discourse, education
    - both MSA, CLA are al-arabiyyatu lfusha (not al-ammiyya)
- no point at which CLA->MSA (approx mid.19c)
- some dialects are 'prestige'
### 0.3 Aims of This Book

## 1 A Brief History of Arabic
### 1.1 Arabic as a Semitic Language
- semitic l.f. supposed to have parent lang proto-semitic
- earliest attested texts from ancient Near East (Syria-Palestine, Mesopotamia)

    - short, strict prosodic rules
    - elegy, panegyric, satire
    - problems: poetry was orally transmitted, it's not casual
    - shows dialectal differences
    - special register of language, based on dialect of C., E. Arabia
    - cannot resolve extent of differences
    - fully comprehensible though
- The Koran
    - many similar problems
    - history
      - revealed to Muhammad, illiterate Qurayshi, AD 610, age 40, for 23y

    - Versteegh: people <-> conquerors in pidgin
    - decreolisation
    - but no mention
    - some texts show changes in dirn of MidA
    - some suggest non-classical koine
    - reductions in same ways
  - The Arabicization of ESINA
    - egypt: not much encouragement
      - coptic, greek remained
      - arabic dominates from early 8c
      - immigration, islam, army disb
    - syria: mass flight of greeks
      - no new urban centres
      - but arabic from early 8c
      - arabic supplanted aram in cities fast

      - new towns, cities
    - migration, assimilation
      - new arab blood
  - 3rd, 4th most important
    - 1st predisposing but NA
    - 2nd but Persia, C. Asia, N. Iraq
### 1.4 Middle Arabic, Modern Dialects, Evolution of MSA
- have distinguished arabiyya (poetry, Quran)/tribal dialects (OA)
    - morphosyntactic features +/-
    - accelerated in conq. lands
    - but didn't affect Bedouin dialects
- can trace devpts in middle Ar
- in 750, Umayyad -> Abbasid dynasty
- codification of arabic started
    - first in late 8c by al-Khalil
    - extrap from Quran, poetry
    - never changed for 7 cents
    - till 850, ?iraab was necessary for intellectual career
- diversification of style by 1258
    - arabiyya became rigid, but translation started
    - also increasing polit. fragmentation
    - by 912, arabiyya was only literary; ?iraab was pedantry
- wide range of styles in lit. from late 11c to mid-13c
    - maqaamaat
    - Baha al-Din Zuhayr
    - Usaama bin Munqidh
    - Yaaquut, al-Qazwini
    - Bani Hilal, Antar
- inner arabia ~ OA
- arabiyya had come to be canonised
- ^ all this stayed same until beginning 19c
    - during this, political subjugation to Turks
    - renaissance of lit. arabic because of west (Chr clerics)
    - Muhammad Ali kicked French out of Egypt, ruled for 145y
    - pressure to modernise arabic
    - unifying symbol after WW1
    - arabic academies in Damascus, Cr
    - two options to solidify use of arabic: simplify or use dialects
        - both were bruh
### 1.5 The Contemporary Ling Situation
- gradual narrowing of gap bw spoken arabic and arabiyya
    - education, literacy ^
    - loan translation
    - regional diff in MSA (Maghreb/Mashreq)
- varieties intermed. bw MSA and reg
- exposure to MSA, CLA in school
- diglossia is oversimplification
    - spectrum MSA <-> reg (rur/urb)
    - capital dialects "standard"
    - "levelling" and "standardisation"
    - written colloquial arabic

## 2 Arabic as a Semitic Language
### 2.1 The Classification of the Semitic Languages
- akkadian is earliest attested (Mesop., 2500-600B)
- 2000B~: Babylonian + Assyrian
- Syro-Pal era: Eblaitic, Ugaritic, ...
- languages in this area: NW Semitic
    - Aramaic
      - old (Syria)
      - west (Palestine), east (Syriac)
    - Canaanite (Hebrew + Phoenician)
- Arabian Penins, Eth.:
    - south Arabian
    - Ge'ez

- was thought that Proto-semitic could be constructed
  - contiguousness was problem
- many features "typically Semitic"
  - triradicalism
  - emphatic/glottalised consonants
  - special reln betn v, c
  - parataxis
  - pfx, sfx constructions
- typological classification (not genealogical) is not an issue
- many urheimats posited
  - either waves of migration
  - or gradual infiltrations
    - garbini: syrian region, nomads <-> sedents

- usually assumed
  - 3000B: NE Sem (Akkadian etc) and baki
  - 2000B: West -> NW, SW
  - 1000B: NW -> Canaanite, Aramaic, U., E.
           SW -> Arabic, S. Arabian, Eth
- still unclear
### 2.2 The Position of Arabic
- arabic remains model for semitic languages
- genealogical posn is a problem
- customary: south semitic
    - broken plurals
    - others have morpheme
    - common phon devpts
- but innovns shared w NW
    - personal sfx in past
    - formation of imperfect
    - definite article (from demonstr)
    - 3rd pers prons
    - -ah fem ending
- this prompted Hetzron's C. Sem = Arabic + Canaanite, Aramaic
  - subgrouping based on -na in fem pl
  - arabic + hebrew vs aramaic

- otherwise, Garbini's theory
    - groups of speakers bedouinised from syria
    - 2nd half of 2cB
    - influence by south arabian languages

- proto-sem reconstructions have been based on arabic
    - so it looks archaic
- old features
    - interdentals
    - velars, pharyngeals full set
    - full nominal declension
- some innovations
    - nunation for indefiniteness
    - definite article 'l-
    - internal passive
    - velarised emphatic consts
    - etc.

- :. common features with both southern and northern
- also unique innovations
- little basis for genealogical classifn
