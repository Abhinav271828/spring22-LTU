# MA – SFV
## 2 Phonology
- facilitate comparison of MSA, dialects (56)
- mutual influence: 2.3
- problem with MSA
  - not natively spoken
  - fasaaha <- historical prec (CLA)
  - less information of early pd
- Sibawayhi describes phonemes
  - but nonphonemic matters (57)
  - suprasegmentals
- usually reflects dialect

- 28 consonants, 3 vowels
  - /w/, /y/ actually semi
  - only distinction: allowed initially
- 8 (post)velar cons: "guttural"
- plain/emphatic (velarised) distinct
  - emphasis spreads

### 2.1 The Phonology of MSA
- dependent on region (58)
- little known about OA
  - no convention has historical validity
- lay view: Quraysh -> CLA -> MSA (59)

#### 2.1.1 Segmental Phonology
- brackets: formal but not religious situations
  - MSA /j/
    - egypt, ~oman: /g/
    - SLPJ, NA: /ž/ (damascus beirut etc)
  - MSA /∂/
    - Cairo: /ż/
    - Iraq, Gulf, Arabia: normal
  - MSA /θ/, //
    - Cairo: /s/, /z/ (not so much)

- three vowel qualities
  - /i/: close, front, lipspread
  - /u/: close, back, liprounded
  - /a/: open
- realisation depends on context (60)
  - /œ/
  - /å/
  - /a/
  - /e/

#### 2.1.2 Syllable Structure
- all begin with single consonant (61)
  - open: Cv, Cv:
  - closed: CvC, Cv:C, CvCC, Cv:CC
- positional restrictions
- in spoken prose, only Cv, Cv:, CvC
  - some exceptions

#### 2.1.3 Neutralisation
- careful: long v, c maintained
  - except prepause
- distinction betn shortened and short (62)
  - stress (nonphonemic)
- pronominal sfxs kept long always

#### 2.1.4 Stress
- nonphonemic
- secular MSA <-> Mashreqi dialects
- variation
- syllables = heavy (4 segs), light (≤ 3) (63)
  - ≤ 1 heavy/word (stressed)
  - all light ≤ 3s:
    - penult
    - Cv:Cv_: antepenult
    - CvCv_: "  "
  - all light > 4s:
    - last Cv:
    - antepenult otherwise
- Cairo: first neut. then stress

#### 2.1.5 Pausal and Junctural Phenomena
- pause = audible break in delivery
- prepause:
  - final short vowels omitted
  - indefiniteness (65)
    - -un: omitted
    - -in: gen. ye but adj. no
    - -an: retain/-a:
  - -t(-u/a/i(n)) omitted (66)
  - -i: for weak root wale nouns (67)

- wide range of styles accepted as fusha (68)
- mistakes in these things ok
- order of acceptability of features

#### 2.1.6 "Secular" and "religious" pronunciation
- difference between heritage fusha and tajweed
  - latter needs other conventions

### 2.2 The Phonology of the Dialects
- reduced and restructured consonant system (69)
- more complexity in vowels

#### 2.2.1 Segmental Phonology
- lost/restruc some distinctions
- also varies with socioeconomic lifestyle (70)
  - bedouin (archaic feats)
  - sedentary
  - rural
- following have acquired status of markers

- interdentals
  - bedouin: preserve
  - city: mg with dentals
  - bedouin: dental d merged with ∂ (71)
  - Syr, Jor, Eg: /s/, /z/
    - inter > fric > dentals
  - clash between pan-Arab prestige & locally domnt socg (73)
  - it's weird

- velars and uvulars
  - east city dlc: preserve /k/, /q/ -> /?/, /?/ -> /y/w/-/
  - rural: /q/ -> /k/ -> /č/
  - bedouin: /q/ -> /g/, sometimes /j/dz/ (also /k/ -> /č/ts/) w/ front v
  - Jordan (74)
  - Kuwait

- alveolar affricate /j/ (75)
  - Egypt: /g/
  - Levant: /ž/ (also L.MSA) (76)
  - rur., bed: /j/ only
  - L. Iraq, Gulf: /y/

#### 2.2.2 Aspects of Suprasegmental Dialectal Phonology
- Cairene and Bahraini

- syllable types and consonant clusters
- stress (79)
  - predictable and automatic
  - according to presence of bound morphemes
  - nondistinctive

### 2.3 Phonological Variation in the Dialects
- MSA to dialect influence (81)

#### 2.3.1 /q/
- N. Iraq, Oman, Yemen, NA: /q/
- eastern cities: /?/
- nomads: /g/j/
- rural: /k/
- some phrases are "implanted" from MSA (82)
  - syllable structure, i. syntax, cons. segs are unassimilated
  - e.g. vowels may change
  - relation betn semantic scope & dialectal change (84)
  - reverse also true
  - general: more specialised, less adjustment (either dirn) (85)
  - variation occurs when there is semantic overlap

#### 2.3.2 Hybridisation and Language Level
- above is contributory to a more general process (86)
- morphological covariance asw
  - choices are not indept
  - reliance across levels (88)
- conditional envt (89)
  - same in principle to Labov's BEV

### 2.4 Phonology and Script
- dit betn orth & phon

#### 2.4.1 MSA Phonology and Orthography
- close and consistent
- 27 consonant letters, one ?alif
- written word: cons skeleton
- vowels written indept of phonetic value

- hamza (90)
  - normal cons, but not letter
  - compromise betn western (no /?/) and eastern (yes /?/)
  - written on kursi:

- final /ay/ (91)
  - pronounced with /a:/ (east) but glide is written (west)

- case endings
  - -u/a/in
  - marked in fully v'd script
  - o/w: only ?alif

- article
  - l- but syll struc
  - ?al- (sometimes redund)
  - assimilated to some

- feminine marker for nouns (92)
  - -a prepausally
  - -t- before case endings in juncture

- particles & preps
  - some part of following word
  - some not

- redund ?alif
  - protecting -u:/-w

#### 2.4.2 Dialect and Orthography
- "not appropriate for writing" (93)
- colloquialised standard (pop lit)
  - e.g. 1001 Nights etc
- different traditions for transliteration
  - e.g. Bahraini

## 2 Phonetics
### 2.1 Introduction
### 2.2 The Arabic Phonetic System
#### 2.2.1 Classical Arabic
- 28/29 consts (?alif) (38)
  - 25 nonvocalic (hajjiz, madraza)
  - 4 vocalic (?ajwaf)
  - some categories – Al-Khalil
- variation (Sibawayhi esp)
  - 6 "good" secondary artics
  - 7 "bad"
- vowel system – al-Khasa:?is
  - i,u,a vs i:,u:,a:

- clearly semitic
  - reduced v, rich c

  - triadic org (vl/v/phar)

#### 2.2.2 Modern Standard Arabic
- the consonant system (39)
  - 28
  - some small changes
  - above average
- the vowel system (40)
  - elementary

### 2.3 The Contribution of Experimental Phonetics
- end 12c to beginning 13c: first rep of vocal tract
- Sibawayhi: mazhu:ra vs. mahmu:sa

#### 2.3.1 Pharyngeal Consonants
- ayn, ha – guttural
- Sibawayhi
  - /h/ is fric, raxw
  - ayn is between stop (shadeed) and raxw: "tardeed" – actually stop tho
- some complex stuff (41)

#### 2.3.2 The Pharyngealised Consonants
- t, d, d, s
- l has allophone
- "emphatic"

#### 2.3.3 Duration

### 3.1 Introduction
- Sibawayhi again (50)
  - inventory
  - phonological processes

### 3.2 State of the Art
#### 3.2.1 Phonotactic Restrictions on Consonant Co-occurrence in Arabic Verbal Roots
- nonconcatenative morphology (51)
- two key patterns in roots ABC (52)
  - A ≠ B, no restriction on (B,C)
  - something on homorganic ones
- four classes, which can combine inter but not intra (rare)
- bunch of stuff

#### 3.2.2 Postvelar Consonants and Emphasis
- emphasis = postvelar secondary articulation (55)
- can spread
- Sib: "mutbaq" as opposed to "munfatih"

#### 3.2.3 Syllabification and Syllable Structure
- informal vC vs. Cv dialect distinction (57)

#### 3.2.4 Word Stress and Metrical Theory

### 3.3 Conclusion

# RHAL
## 1 Introduction
## 2 Historical Background ***
- first Al-Khaliil (11)
- then Sibawayh
- Ibn Jinni the only original dude after

## 3 Critical Issues and Topics
### 3.1 Phonemic Inventory
- rich c, limited v (12)
- kept pharyngeal and emphatic cons of P-S

### 3.2 MSA and CA
- d with a dot
  - emphatic /d/
  - but sib says no non-emph counterpart
  - dk what it is (13)
- t with a dot
  - emphatic /t/
  - Sib says emphatic /d/
- q
  - sib: voiced uv stop
- otherwise identical

### 3.3 MSA and Modern Arabic Varieties
- a bit on dialects
- five clusters: GA, IA, YA, LA, EA, MA

#### 3.3.1 Interdental Fricatives /th/, /dh/, /d bar/
- interdental fricatives (14)
- same in G, Y, I: /d dot/ merged to /d bar/
  - also Jordan, Tunisia
- L, Hijazi, E, M: /t/, /d/, /d dot/
- E, L: /s/, /z/, /z dot/ in borrowings

#### 3.3.2 Voiced Alveolo-Palatal Affricate /dz/
- Cairo: /g/ (15)
- M, L: /ž/
- I, Y, G: same, varn with /j/ tho

#### 3.3.3 Voiceless Uvular Stop /q/
- M: /q/ or /?/ or /g/
- E: /?/ (upper eg: /g/)
- L: /q/, /?/ in cities, /g/, /q/ in rur
  - Palestine: /k/, /ts/ in rur
  - Jord: /g/

#### 3.3.4 Emphatic Segments
- s, t, d, d, l
- M: 5 in Libyan, 8 in Tunisian, 6 in Moroccan (16)
- G, Y: 4
- IA: has m + GY's 4
- EA: 4 and LA: 3 (t, s, d, maybe z)

#### 3.3.5 The Diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/
- /i:/ and /u:/ in most groups (G, I, L, E)
- Y, L: kept?
- M: /ii/, /uu/

#### 3.3.6 Short and Long Vowels
- G, I, Y, E: three short vowels
- L: /i/, /u/ merged to schwa
- M: all merged to schwa or deleted

- G, I, E, M: long all there (shortened in M)

#### 3.3.7 Phonotactics and Syllable Structure
- constraints on root consonants (17)
  - homorganic in root
  - M: /ž/ replaced with /g/d/ when /z/ or /s/ occurs

- syllable structure (19)
  - Cv, Cvv, CvC predominant, free
  - CvCC, CvvC, CvvCC only final
  - E: full set
  - I, G: those + CCv(v/c)(c)
  - L: these 11 minus CvvCC
  - M: variation
  - Y: maybe CvCCC also? (20)

#### 3.3.8 Stress
- not mentioned
- non phonemic
- usual pattern (MSA, CA)
  - not final
  - penult if heavy, else antepenult

- eastern: first v: or vCC from end (else first) (21)
- I: final super heavy
- F: same
- Y: some weird shit
- E: same
- L: final superheavy OR last heavy non-final OR initial
- M: god alone knows

#### 3.3.9 Phonological Processes
- affrication (22)
  - /g/k/ to /dz/ts/ adj to front v
  - feature of G
- lenition (23)
  - /dz/ weakens to /j/
  - G, S.I
- /q/ vs /R/
- pharyngealisation (24)
  - emphatics backen surroundings
  - spreading of [+RTR]
  - L: both directions
    - Syr, Pal: some segs block; not J
    - i, j, s, dz, w, u
  - G: both upto 6, more left, right blocked
  - Y: ...
- definite article assimilation (25)
  - it happens
  - dz doesnt though, came from /g/ thats why

# AHD
## 7.5 Phonetics and Phonology
### 7.5.1 gim
- formerly voiced velar /g/ (176)
- /ž/ increasing and /gv/ decreasing

### 7.5.2 The Shift of Interdentals to Dentals

- L adds /i/ betn -C and CC- (12)

### B Vowels
- final /a/ often /e/ in L (13)
  - unless word has /r/, back, emph
- -u is -o in L for him/his
- il -> li if cluster follows (14)
- some switching in verbs idrk
- nouns ending CCV make it CVC (15)

### C Stress
- idk (16)
