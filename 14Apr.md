# Lexical Semantic Relations
Examples of lexical semantic relations are synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, etc.

These also relate to word association.

# Revision
We have seen Greenberg's school of thought, which hypothesises universals across diferrent languages in all levels – phonology, syntax, morphology, etc.

Chomsky and Skinner differed in their schools of thought – Skinner's behaviourist theory was upturned by Chomsky's mentalist views on the language acquisition. This debate gave rise to the nature-nurture controversy.  

We have seen language attrition as well, which can occur due to diseases like aphasia. This affects Broca's and Wernicke's areas.
