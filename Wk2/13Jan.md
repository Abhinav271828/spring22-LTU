# Writing Systems
There are many types of writing systems used by various languages and language families.  
Abugidas are scripts in which vowels are added as markings to consonant symbols, like Devanagari and south Indian scripts.  
Alphabets are those in which each sound is represented by a letter, whether a consonant or a vowel. The Latin and Greek scripts are of this type.  
Syllabaries use a different symbol for each syllable, which is not decomposable into symbol representing the constituent sounds, as in Japanese and Cherokee.  
Abjads are scripts in which vowels may be omitted, like Perso-Arabic and Hebrew.
